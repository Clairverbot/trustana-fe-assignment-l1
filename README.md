## A note on bonus tasks

The truth is, I spent too much time buying bak kwa before cny and I ran out of time. I attempted some of these features in [this school project](https://github.com/Clairverbot/cs301-frontend/blob/main/src/components/RewardsTransactions.js), which includes caching, search and pagination with debounce and throttling.

Thanks and happy cny
